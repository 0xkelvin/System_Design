# System_Design
1. Scalability and Performance

	•	Concepts: Vertical vs. horizontal scaling, load balancing, caching, and performance optimization.
	•	Practices: Using tools like CDNs, database indexing, and distributed systems.

2. Reliability and Fault Tolerance

	•	Concepts: Redundancy, failover mechanisms, replication, and data consistency.
	•	Practices: Designing for graceful degradation, implementing retries and circuit breakers.

3. Security

	•	Concepts: Authentication, authorization, encryption, and secure coding practices.
	•	Practices: Implementing OAuth, SSL/TLS, and regular security audits.

4. Database Design

	•	Concepts: Normalization vs. denormalization, ACID vs. BASE properties, and NoSQL vs. SQL databases.
	•	Practices: Choosing the right database type, designing schemas, and optimizing queries.

5. API Design

	•	Concepts: REST vs. GraphQL, versioning, and designing for simplicity and flexibility.
	•	Practices: Writing clear documentation, using API gateways, and implementing rate limiting.

6. Microservices Architecture

	•	Concepts: Service decomposition, inter-service communication, and eventual consistency.
	•	Practices: Using tools like Docker and Kubernetes, managing microservice dependencies, and monitoring.

7. Cloud Architecture

	•	Concepts: IaaS, PaaS, SaaS, serverless architecture, and cloud-native applications.
	•	Practices: Leveraging services from providers like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud, and designing for cost efficiency.

8. DevOps and Automation
